        <p>Kafka is writing about our living in a world that 
          is too vast and complex for us to understand by any means at all,
          religion, science, maths, art, or psychology 
          (and in which the functioning of our very minds are also beyond our comprehension)
          … our ideas of a transcendental order of any kind, which we often believe supply 
          an uber justification and order to this world, are even more incomprehensible 
          because the transcendental order is absolutely incomprehensible to us.
          Eg why in the world does God kill so many babies, if God is the transcendental supreme?
          It just can’t make sense, but we have to live through it all anyway, and it is far from simple.
          The darkness in our minds and our social orders, literal, moral,
          or whatever else are still there and have to be lived through 
          with varying degrees of awareness and sensitivity by all of us. We can make all sorts of choices,
          but can’t change the basic situation.</p>
