        <!--<p>Kafka is writing about our living in a world that<br>
          is too vast and complex for us to understand by any means at all,</br>
          religion, science, maths, art, or psychology<br> 
          (and in which the functioning of our very minds are also beyond our comprehension)<br>
          … our ideas of a transcendental order of any kind, which we often believe supply<br>
          an uber justification and order to this world, are even more incomprehensible<br>
          because the transcendental order is absolutely incomprehensible to us.<br>
          Eg why in the world does God kill so many babies, if God is the transcendental supreme?<br>
          It just can’t make sense, but we have to live through it all anyway, and it is far from simple.<br>
          The darkness in our minds and our social orders, literal, moral,<br>
          or whatever else are still there and have to be lived through<br>
          with varying degrees of awareness and sensitivity by all of us.<br> 
          We can make all sorts of choices, but can’t change the basic situation.</p> -->
